# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs throughout development is key to delivering a product that meets all requirements.  Conducting user interviews and surveys can help give us the information needed to implement features that users will enjoy. User stories are one of the most important steps to gathering feedback and turning it into functional features. This process helps break down the idea into actionable steps for the development team. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs I like to understand the project's goals and how they align with user needs. These steps are important and allow me to break down each task into smaller iterations. I want to incorporate iterative development and regular retrospectives into my future development work. These steps help me develop faster in increments while also helping give feedback and suggestions for current features. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member means to be open and transparent about progress, challenges, and needs. Understanding the diverse skills and perspectives within a team can help all of us communicate openly about any roadblocks. There are many characteristics to what makes a good team member but treating everyone with respect is most important.
